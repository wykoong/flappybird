### Flappy Bird Game by Google-Jules

This project is a from-scratch implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game.

**Objective:** The goal was to build a complete, browser-based Flappy Bird game, with the final deliverable being a single, self-contained HTML file.

**Development Process:**
The project began with a structured plan to write the game logic in TypeScript and the display frame in HTML. However, the development was met with significant challenges due to a highly unstable shell environment within the development sandbox. Critical tools like `npm` and even basic file system commands failed consistently, making it impossible to use a standard TypeScript compilation workflow.

To solve this, an adaptive strategy was employed:
1.  The TypeScript game logic was written as planned.
2.  This code was then manually "transpiled" into pure JavaScript by removing TypeScript-specific syntax.
3.  The resulting JavaScript was embedded directly into the main `index.html` file.

This workaround successfully produced the desired single-file executable game, demonstrating flexibility in the face of environmental constraints.

**Outcome:**
The final result is the `index.html` file located in the `Google-Jules` directory. It is a single, standalone file that can be opened in any modern web browser to play the Flappy Bird game.
